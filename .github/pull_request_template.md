## Conventional Commit Spec

PR titles should be in the format `<type>(<scope>): <description>`. For example: `chore(readme): fix typo`

`type` can be any of the follow:
  - `feat`: a feature, or breaking change
  - `fix`: a bug-fix
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - `docs`: documentation only changes (readme, changelog, contributing guide)
  - `refactor`: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `chore`: reoccurring tasks for project maintainability (example scopes: release, deps)
  - `config`: changes to tooling configurations used in the project
  - `build`: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: npm, bundler, gradle)
  - `ci`: changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: travis)
  - `perf`: a code change that improves performance
  - `style`: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

`scope` is optional, and can be anything.
`description` should be a short description of the change, written in the imperative-mood.
